# Documentation for `mod_tbfit.f90`

## Overview

`mod_tbfit.f90` defines a Fortran module named `tbfitlib`. Based on its current content, this module primarily serves as a container or a high-level module that imports several other key modules from the TBFIT package. It does not appear to define its own procedures or variables directly within its scope.

Its role might be to provide a single point of access to commonly used functionalities from other modules, simplifying `use` statements in other parts of the TBFIT codebase, or it might be intended for future expansion.

## Key Components

- **Module Definition:**
    - `module tbfitlib`: Declares the module.

- **Imported Modules:**
    - `use parameters`: Imports definitions for various parameters, likely including derived types for inputs, outputs, and physical constants.
    - `use mpi_setup`: Imports MPI (Message Passing Interface) setup routines, used for parallel processing.
    - `use time`: Imports utilities for timekeeping and performance measurement.
    - `use version`: Imports version information of the TBFIT package.
    - `use print_io`: Imports routines for handling printing, logging, and other I/O operations.

## Important Variables/Constants

As of the current version, `tbfitlib` does not define any module-specific variables or constants directly. Any variables or constants would be accessed through the imported modules.

## Usage Examples

If `tbfitlib` is used in other Fortran files, it would be via a `use` statement:

```fortran
program some_other_program
  use tbfitlib
  implicit none

  ! ... code that might use types or procedures from the imported modules ...
  ! For example, using a type from 'parameters' module:
  ! type(incar) :: my_input_params
  ! call parse_input(my_input_params) ! Assuming parse_input is available via one of the used modules

end program some_other_program
```

However, without specific subroutines or functions defined directly within `tbfitlib`, its primary utility comes from the collective availability of the modules it imports.

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Dependencies:**
    - `parameters`: Relies on this module for data structures and parameter definitions.
    - `mpi_setup`: Relies on this for MPI functionalities.
    - `time`: Relies on this for timing functions.
    - `version`: Relies on this for version data.
    - `print_io`: Relies on this for input/output operations.
- **Interactions:**
    - Any Fortran file that `use tbfitlib` will have access to the public components of all the modules used by `tbfitlib`.
- **Includes:**
    - `alias.inc`: This file likely contains preprocessor directives or common aliases used throughout the Fortran source code. It's included before the module definition, suggesting it might set up compilation environment or macros.

The module `tbfitlib` itself is a high-level organizational unit. The core logic and data structures are defined within the modules it uses.
